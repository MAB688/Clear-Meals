## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```


## Next Dev Steps:

0. Fix API request
1. Create a function in SearchScreen to add a selected food to a meal (you'll need to manage meal state, possibly in a context or Redux).
2. Use DailyLog in your main app component or a dedicated screen to display the user's daily food intake.
3. Implement AsyncStorage to save and load DailyLog data.
4. Consider creating a MealContext or using Redux to manage the global state of meals and daily logs.
